The need for a Brocade Simulator to learn the CLI
# Introduction #

Brocade Ethernet Simulator


Upon hearing of an official simulator or emulator I stop working on the one I was creating.  However after 2 and a half years  I have been as yet unable to come across the program or any other for that matter.

After the post by btebo - located at http://community.brocade.com/thread/6893?tstart=0 I thought it might be time to revive my effects in this matter.

My goal when I created it was to be able to simulator the CLI interface of a Brocade FastIron SX 1600, I knew then as now, that I did not and do not have the time to create an emulator. That and of course the fact I am not a professional programmer.

So to that effect I will try and find some time for what at least I hope will be of benefit to people new to Brocade's Ethernet CLI (or classic Foundry Networks CLI).

The simulator as it stands now is at this point to be considered to be barely working , but for those interested in learning the Brocade CLI please download and try it out, or even better feel free help in the effort.
